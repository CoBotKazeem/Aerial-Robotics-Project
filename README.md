# Aerial-Robotics-Project
 Implement a controller for a  2D and 3D quadrotor. Test the controller with two trajectories, a horizontal line trajectory and a more complex sine wave-shaped trajectory, such that the error between the desired position from the trajectory and the robotâ€™s actual position is small.
